# Houses
A program that produces class rosters from imported student data using python to query a SQL database. This program was created to accompany my studies of databases in computer science.

### Motivation
This was motivated by Harvard's CS50 and partly includes their distribution code.

### Usage
Usage: python import.py characters.csv
       python roster.py house
